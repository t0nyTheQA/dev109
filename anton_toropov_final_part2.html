            <strong>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I had broad experience with HTML and CSS, and almost none with Javascript. I know HTML the best because my job requires me to do alot of UI testing, which naturally leads me to look over the page using the inspect tool and go thru the HTML Dom, and use Xpaths to find certain elements. I used CSS on my own time when I was learning how to code for my job, just basic style components. Regarding JS, I didnt use it before, but after this class I am much more capable of it becasue it is familiar to other programming languges I use.</p>

            <strong>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I used a mixture of both. I wanted to start from scratch but also wanted to have a clean look of my webpage, so I started with basic HTML and CSS on my own, and then implemented outside and course provided resources to make my own portfolio look how I wanted it. I think a mixture between a template and personal style is good for UX and feel of the page, because you can add personal touches while maintaining a professional template </p>
        </li>

            <strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The toughest challange for me was maintaining the CSS to affect all the pages to have the same feel and look. Specifically lining up the images in the artifacts and modules pages was a challenge </p>

            <strong>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I learned that web development is much easier then it seems when you know the tools required to create a web application. You can make a very well, visually appealing website with only the 3 tools of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also the class showed that its more then just coding it, but taking in account user experience, accessibility and usability  </p>

            <strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I would recommend future students to spend time working on their projects and trying to understand exacly what they are doing and what each thing they are adding is doing. I would recommend to seek additional resources outside of the class to get different approaches on different problems. The best way to learn is to do, so I would suggest to spend time outside of class to do some personal projects as well.</p>
